# Development version

- `format-suggest.yaml` now works as expected on pull requests originating from a fork.

- The example workflows, `format-check.yaml` and `format-suggest.yaml`, now pin to explicit SHAs of their dependencies, limiting the possibility for vulnerabilities.

# `v1.0.0` (2025-04-28)

- First release!
